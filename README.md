Description

Vision Statement

  To build a game that's awesome (hopefully) to play. For developers. By developers

Risks

  This is the first official club project so we're getting this all figured out.

Mitigation

  The more experienced people will take time to teach the less experienced people how to use C# and Unity. And frequent communication. We will focus on organization and delegate tasks in a reasonable and productive manner. Simple geometric models, and dedication to creating assests. Frequent communication.
